## How it works

### Setup

On boot, the ESP32 attempts to connect to saved WiFi credentials. If none exist, it opens a captive portal for the user to enter WiFi details and (optionally) a season year for F1 standings. WiFi details are stored in flash memory.

### Data Sources

The device fetches data from the following public APIs:

- **F1 data** from [jolpi.ca/ergast](https://api.jolpi.ca/ergast/)
  - Race schedule, qualifying times, constructor & driver standings

- **IP Geolocation** from [ip-api.com](https://ip-api.com/)
  - Used to determine latitude/longitude and IP for timezone lookup

- **Timezone info** from [worldtimeapi.org](http://worldtimeapi.org/)
  - Raw and DST offsets based on IP, used for setting system time

- **Weather data** from [open-meteo.com](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs)
  - Hourly temperature, cloud coverage, and precipitation probability

Functions for fetching data are with retry logic and limit, for handling faiure on API calls.

### Runtime Behavior

The display cycles through 5 stages: Clock, Weather, Constructor Standings, Driver Standings, and Race Info. Stage switches automatically every 15 minutes or on button press.

- Weather is refreshed every hour
- F1 data is refreshed 2 hours after a race completes
- Notifications are triggered before race/quali sessions
- LCD enters night mode (off) between 23:00‚Äì06:00 unless overridden

Short and long button presses are used for navigation and toggling night mode. No user interaction is required after setup.
